# ZombieDoorBreaking
This plugin gives SCP-049-2 a new ability to work alongside other infected humans, improving on it's `"swarm"` thematic by allowing them to open doors that usually can't be open by normal SCPs if there's enough around. Overall, pretty simple! (It still needs [EXILED](https://github.com/galaxy119/EXILED "EXILED") to work tho!).
